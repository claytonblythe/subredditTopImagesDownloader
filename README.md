## Usage

To use this utility: 

1. Type "git clone https://github.com/claytonblythe/subredditTopImagesDownloader.git" in a directory where you want this repository to reside
2. Type "cd code" to navigate into the directory with the script
3. Type "python subredditTopImagesDownloaderGenerator.py" to run the script, which will by default download the images from the top page of all-time most 
upvoted posts on r/EarthPorn 

If you wish to download from a specific subreddit, over a range of pages, and over a specified time you can specify this with command line arguments of -s, -n, and -t respectively. Below is an example of how you can use this functionality.

Overall I am very satisfied with the result. I am still learning Python so I am open to any suggestions anyone has to improve performance and/or write better code. 

Hope you find this useful.
